# Hopper's Bugs
Hopper's Bugs is a 2D pixel art platformer, where you play as Jo Hopper, an Entomologist, who is getting ready for the annual Bug Off! Conference. 

But before Jo can go to the conference and show off his bugs, it looks like there is a mischievous computer glitch on his laptop, and it has released all of the bugs out of their jars!
